<b>1- I perform simple classification operations with very simple neural networks such as Heb and Perceptron.</b>

<b>2- Networks can be configured with the help of the program's graphical interface. </b>

<b>3- It also has the ability to generate data for categorization.</b>

<b>4- In addition, grid weight correction calculations can be viewed.</b>






The project you observed is a simple and prototype of artificial neural networks in which the volume of calculations can be seen.
To know and work with large and complex networks such as #YOLO , #FasterRCNN  Knowing and how these networks work can be helpful.
