<b>1- I perform simple classification operations with very simple neural networks such as Heb and Perceptron.</b>

<b>2- Networks can be configured with the help of the program's graphical interface. </b>

<b>3- It also has the ability to generate data for categorization.</b>

<b>4- In addition, grid weight correction calculations can be viewed.</b>

The project you observed is a simple and prototype of artificial neural networks in which the volume of calculations can be seen.
To know and work with large and complex networks such as ??? Knowing and how these networks work can be helpful.
